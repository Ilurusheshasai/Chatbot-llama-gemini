In a Persian town, two siblings, Cassim and Ali Baba, inherit equal shares from their father. Cassim enhances his fortune by marrying a wealthy woman, thus rising to the status of a prosperous merchant. Conversely, Ali Baba, marrying a woman of similar financial standing to his own, maintains a humble existence. He earns his livelihood by chopping wood in the forest and selling it in the town, relying on three donkeys to transport his goods.

During one of his regular trips to the forest, Ali Baba, having gathered sufficient wood for his donkeys, notices an unusual, approaching dust cloud. As it nears, he discerns a group of horsemen within the dust and, suspecting them to be robbers, quickly assesses the danger. Prioritizing his safety, he leaves his donkeys behind and swiftly climbs a strategically located tree. This tree, situated atop a high rock, provides him with both concealment and a clear vantage point, allowing him to observe the horsemen's actions without risking detection.

The approaching group, consisting of forty well-armed men on horseback, halts at the base of the rock supporting Ali Baba's hiding place. Methodically, each man attends to his horse, securing the animal to a nearby shrub and providing it with corn. They then remove their saddle-bags, heavy and seemingly filled with valuables, possibly gold and silver. The leader of the group, identified by Ali Baba as their captain, approaches the rock and utters the mystic words, "Open, Sesame!" This incantation causes a hidden door in the rock to open, revealing a secret entrance. One by one, the men enter this hidden doorway, followed by their captain, after which the door closes seamlessly, as if by magic.

The band of robbers spends a considerable amount of time inside the mysterious rock cavern. During their stay, Ali Baba, gripped by a mix of fear and curiosity, stays perched in his arboreal hideout. He remains motionless and silent, acutely aware that discovery could mean his peril.

Eventually, the secret door reopens, revealing the robbers who begin to exit the cavern. The captain, who was the last to enter, is now the first to emerge, overseeing the departure of his men. Ali Baba listens as the captain utters “Shut, Sesame,” causing the door to close. The robbers then promptly prepare their horses for departure, securing their saddle-bags and mounting up. Once all are ready, the captain leads his band away from the scene, retracing their path back.

Ali Baba keenly watches the robbers until they disappear from sight. He remains in the tree for a while longer, ensuring his safety. Curiosity piqued, he decides to test the magical words he overheard. Approaching the hidden door amidst the shrubs, he confidently speaks, “Open, Sesame!” To his amazement, the door obeys his command, swinging open instantly, just as it had for the robbers.

Upon entering the cave, Ali Baba is taken aback to find not a gloomy hideout but a well-lit, expansive chamber illuminated from an opening above. The cave is a treasure trove, filled with various provisions, luxurious fabrics like silk and brocade, exquisite carpets, and piles of gold and silver ingots alongside bags of money. The magnitude and variety of the riches lead Ali Baba to conclude that this cave has long been a secret stash for generations of robbers.

Ali Baba ventures deeper into the cave and, seizing the opportunity, gathers as many bags of gold coins as he believes his donkeys can carry. After carefully loading the donkeys and camouflaging the loot under wood, he exits the cave, ensuring the door is shut using the magic words. He then hastily makes his way back to town, his donkeys laden with hidden treasure.

Upon returning home, Ali Baba discreetly secures his donkeys in the yard and meticulously removes the wood to reveal the bags of gold. He then carries the treasure inside and arranges it before his wife, revealing a dazzling heap of gold. He recounts his entire adventure to her, emphasizing the necessity of keeping this extraordinary discovery a secret.

Ali Baba's wife is overjoyed by their newfound fortune. She eagerly expresses a desire to count every single gold coin, basking in the reality of their sudden wealth.

Ali Baba, responding to his wife’s intention to count the gold, cautions her about the enormity of such a task, suggesting it would be endless. He proposes a more pragmatic approach: to bury the treasure promptly, emphasizing the urgency of securing their unexpected wealth.

Agreeing with her husband, Ali Baba's wife concedes the impracticality of counting each coin. However, she suggests measuring the gold to estimate their total gain. She decides to borrow a measuring container for this purpose while Ali Baba prepares to dig a hole for the treasure.

Ali Baba's wife hastens to Cassim's house nearby to borrow a measuring vessel. Upon her request, Cassim's wife inquires whether she needs a large or small measure. Opting for a small one, she waits as Cassim's wife goes to retrieve it.

Cassim’s wife, aware of Ali Baba’s modest means, is driven by curiosity to discover what they could be measuring. She cunningly places suet at the bottom of the measure before lending it, hoping to gather clues about the contents. She then apologizes for the delay, citing difficulty in finding the measure.

Ali Baba's wife, upon returning home, proceeds to measure the gold by filling and emptying the borrowed measure onto the sofa repeatedly until she's content with the substantial quantity they possess. Eager to return the measure and demonstrate her promptness, she unknowingly carries back a piece of gold stuck to the measure's bottom, oblivious to the clue it would provide about their newfound wealth.

Upon returning the measure to Cassim's wife, Ali Baba's wife expresses her gratitude, highlighting that she didn’t keep it for long. She offers thanks, unaware of the significant clue left on the measure that would lead to unexpected consequences.

Once Ali Baba’s wife leaves, Cassim’s wife inspects the measure and is astounded to discover a piece of gold adhered to its bottom. This discovery instantly ignites feelings of envy and curiosity about the source of Ali Baba's sudden affluence.

Cassim's wife, astonished, questions how Ali Baba, known for his modest lifestyle, could possess enough gold that it requires measuring. She wonders about the origin of such unexpected and abundant wealth.

Cassim, occupied at his counting house, returns home to a surprising revelation from his wife. She informs him that Ali Baba is immensely wealthier, possessing so much gold that it’s measured rather than counted, challenging Cassim’s perception of his own wealth.

Perplexed, Cassim asks for an explanation. His wife reveals her clever ploy of placing suet in the measure and shows him the ancient gold coin, so old that its era of minting is unrecognizable, further fueling his curiosity and amazement.

Since marrying into wealth, Cassim has distanced himself from Ali Baba, lacking brotherly affection. The revelation of Ali Baba's riches doesn’t bring him joy but rather sparks intense envy. Troubled and restless, he decides to confront Ali Baba early the next morning, driven by a mix of envy and curiosity.

Confronting Ali Baba, Cassim expresses his shock at the discovery that his seemingly impoverished brother is actually measuring gold, presenting the evidence of the gold piece found on the measure borrowed by Ali Baba's wife.

Realizing that his secret is out due to his wife's inadvertence, Ali Baba accepts the situation without showing surprise or distress. He openly confesses the entire story to Cassim, including how he discovered the treasure. To ensure his brother's discretion, Ali Baba generously offers Cassim a share of the treasure.

Cassim responds arrogantly, not just accepting the share but also demanding exact details about the treasure's location and access. He threatens Ali Baba with exposure if his demands aren’t met, indicating that he would claim part of the treasure as a reward for his information.

Faced with Cassim's threats, Ali Baba reveals everything about the treasure, including the location of the cave and the magic words “Open, Sesame!” that grant entry.

Eager to claim his fortune, Cassim sets out at dawn with ten mules and large chests to the forest, following Ali Baba's directions. Finding the cave, he successfully uses the magic words to enter. Overwhelmed by the sight of the riches, far surpassing his expectations, he hastily fills his chests with gold. However, in his excitement and greed, he forgets the exact words to reopen the cave door, mistakenly saying "Open, Barley!" instead of "Open, Sesame!" Despite his frantic attempts with various words, the door remains shut, trapping him inside.

Caught off guard by this unforeseen predicament and realizing the peril he is in, Cassim becomes increasingly panicked. The more he tries to recall the correct word, the more muddled his memory becomes, to the point where he completely forgets the word "Sesame." In a state of distress, he abandons the gold and paces the cave, oblivious to the treasures surrounding him as he grapples with his dire situation.

Around noon, the robbers return to find Cassim's unattended mules with chests near the cave, arousing their suspicion. They quickly ride to the cave, dispersing the mules into the forest. Armed and alert, they approach the cave's entrance, which opens promptly as their captain utters the magic words.

Hearing the approaching horsemen, Cassim realizes the robbers have returned. Seizing a desperate chance to escape, he rushes toward the opening door. As the door opens, he charges out, knocking down the leader, but is quickly overwhelmed by the other robbers. In a swift and brutal act, they use their scimitars to end his life.

After killing Cassim, the robbers' first action is to inspect the cave. They find the bags Cassim had prepared but do not notice the earlier theft by Ali Baba. Puzzled by Cassim's knowledge of the secret words and presence in the cave, they decide to dismember his body and display it as a warning. They execute this gruesome plan and leave the cave securely closed, resuming their marauding activities on the roads.

As night falls and Cassim doesn't return, his wife grows increasingly worried. In distress, she seeks out Ali Baba, sharing her fears and suspicions about Cassim's visit to the forest for the treasure and the potential misfortune that might have befallen him.

Trying to allay her fears, Ali Baba suggests that Cassim might have deliberately chosen to stay late in the forest to avoid attracting attention and would likely return once night had sufficiently fallen, hinting at the need for discretion in their newfound wealth.

"Cassim's wife, considering how much it concerned her husband to keep the business secret, was the more easily persuaded to believe her brother-in-law. She went home again, and waited patiently till midnight. Then her fear redoubled, and her grief was the more sensible because she was forced to keep it to herself. She repented of her foolish curiosity, and cursed her desire of prying into the affairs of her brother and sister-in-law. She spent all the night in weeping; and as soon as it was day went to them, telling them, by her tears, the cause of her coming."

Cassim's wife, persuaded by Ali Baba's reassurance but still concerned, returns home. As midnight passes without Cassim's return, her worry deepens into distress. She regrets her earlier curiosity about Ali Baba's wealth, which now seems to have led to her husband's mysterious absence. Overwhelmed with anxiety and unable to share her fears, she spends a sleepless night weeping. At daybreak, still tearful, she visits Ali Baba and his wife, her tears silently communicating her fears and sorrow.

Ali Baba, understanding the gravity of the situation, leaves immediately with his three donkeys to search for his brother. He heads to the forest, troubled by the absence of any sign of Cassim or the mules along the way. Arriving at the cave, he's greeted by a foreboding scene: blood near the entrance. Uttering "Open, Sesame," he enters the cave and is horrified to discover Cassim's dismembered body. Despite their strained relationship, Ali Baba resolves to give his brother a proper burial. He wraps the body parts and loads them onto one of his donkeys, covering them with wood. The other donkeys are loaded with bags of gold, also concealed under wood. Carefully, he exits the cave, making sure to close it, and cautiously makes his way back to town, avoiding attention.

Ali Baba arrives home with the gruesome burden and the gold. He instructs his wife about unloading the gold-laden donkeys while he takes the donkey carrying Cassim's remains to Cassim's house. There, he entrusts Morgiana, Cassim's clever and resourceful slave, with the task of arranging a discreet and respectful burial. He emphasizes the need for absolute secrecy, relying on Morgiana's wit and skill to manage the situation delicately.

The following morning, Morgiana visits a druggist, requesting a specific type of lozenge used for severe ailments, hinting at a grave illness in her household. The druggist, curious, inquires about the patient, and Morgiana, with a heavy heart, reveals it's her master, Cassim. Her demeanor suggests deep concern for his well-being.

Later that evening, Morgiana returns to the druggist, this time seeking an essence used only in dire medical situations, indicating a turn for the worse in Cassim's condition. She expresses a bleak outlook, fearing the loss of her master despite the remedies, thereby setting the stage for the announcement of Cassim's death.

Amidst this, Ali Baba and his wife are seen moving frequently between their own and Cassim's house, displaying visible signs of sadness. When Morgiana and Cassim's wife begin wailing and announcing Cassim's death that night, their actions appear consistent and believable to the onlookers, ensuring that the community perceives Cassim's death as natural.

Morgiana, early the next morning, approaches an aged cobbler named Baba Mustapha, offering him gold to perform a task requiring his skills. She insists on blindfolding him for part of the journey to the task's location, arousing his suspicion. To alleviate his concerns and ensure his cooperation, she offers additional gold, convincing him to follow her without knowing the destination.

Morgiana leads the blindfolded Baba Mustapha to Cassim's house, only removing the blindfold once inside the room with Cassim's body. She instructs him to sew the body parts together, promising more gold upon completion. After he finishes, she blindfolds him again, escorts him back, and releases him, ensuring he can't retrace his path. She discreetly observes him until he's out of sight, ensuring he doesn't return out of curiosity.

Back at Cassim's house, Morgiana diligently washes the reassembled body, while Ali Baba performs the ritual of scenting it with incense. They wrap the body in burial shrouds, adhering to traditional customs. When the official funeral procession arrives, along with the mosque attendants who normally wash the deceased, Morgiana informs them that the rites have already been completed, ensuring no one suspects the true nature of Cassim's death.

Cassim's funeral is conducted with due solemnity. Morgiana, acting the part of a grieving slave, follows the procession, while Ali Baba and neighbors periodically carry the bier. Cassim's wife remains at home, her cries of mourning mingling with those of other women in the neighborhood, convincingly portraying the image of a family struck by unexpected tragedy.

The secret of Cassim's death is carefully guarded by Ali Baba, his widow, and Morgiana. Their meticulous planning and execution of the burial rite ensure that no one in the city suspects the true circumstances of his demise. Shortly after the funeral, Ali Baba discreetly moves his belongings to Cassim's house, deciding to live there. He discreetly transfers the gold he took from the robbers to this new residence, entrusting the management of Cassim's business to his eldest son.

Meanwhile, the robbers return to their hideout and are shocked to find Cassim's body and some of their gold missing. Realizing someone else knows their secret, they decide it's imperative to find this person for their own safety. The leader proposes that a member of their gang, under threat of death for failure, should go undercover in the city to gather information.
A brave robber volunteers for the mission, entering the city at dawn disguised as a traveler. He encounters Baba Mustapha, who is about to start his day's work. The robber, noticing Baba Mustapha's age, feigns surprise at his ability to see well enough to work in the low light, prompting a conversation.
Intrigued by the robber's remarks, Baba Mustapha boasts about his strong vision, revealing that he recently sewed a dead body together in a dimly lit room. The robber, sensing he's onto something significant, probes further but Baba Mustapha, realizing he might be revealing too much, abruptly stops sharing more details.

The robber, understanding the cobbler's role in his quest, bribes Baba Mustapha for his assistance. He asks the cobbler to lead him to the house where he performed the task, exploiting his curiosity and desire for more gold. Baba Mustapha agrees, albeit uncertain he can recall the exact location, influenced by the temptation of the gold offered.

Baba Mustapha leads the robber, blindfolded, through the town. Upon reaching a certain point, he indicates that this is where he was initially blindfolded. The robber then blindfolds Baba Mustapha and guides him to Cassim's house. Before removing the blindfold, the robber discreetly marks the door with chalk to identify it later, then inquires about the house's owner. Baba Mustapha, unaware of the specifics, is unable to provide an answer.

After parting ways with Baba Mustapha, Morgiana notices the chalk mark on Ali Baba's door. Sensing danger, she cleverly marks several other houses in the same manner, diluting the significance of the original mark and thwarting the robber's plan to identify Ali Baba's house.
The robber, believing his mission successful, returns to the forest and reports his findings to the gang. The robbers, pleased with the seemingly successful reconnaissance, prepare to attack the marked house. They enter the city in small groups to avoid suspicion, planning to meet at the marked house for their revenge.
The leader and the scout robber arrive last in the city and head to the marked house. However, they find multiple houses with similar chalk marks, causing confusion. Unable to determine which house is Ali Baba's, the frustrated leader calls off the mission, and the gang returns to their hideout.
Back at the hideout, the robbers discuss the failed mission. The robber who marked the house accepts responsibility for the blunder and is put to death as per their earlier agreement. Another robber volunteers to try again, promising to succeed where the first had failed.
The second robber, learning from the first's mistake, marks Ali Baba's house more discreetly. However, Morgiana, ever vigilant, notices the new mark and duplicates it on other houses, once again foiling the robbers' plan.
The second robber returns to the forest, confident in his success. However, when he and the leader arrive in the city, they encounter the same problem: multiple houses marked identically. This failure results in the second robber's execution for his inability to identify the correct house.
After losing two of their members, the leader of the robbers decides to take on the task himself, wary of further reducing their numbers. He successfully locates Ali Baba's house and memorizes its appearance without leaving any conspicuous marks.

Accordingly, he went and addressed himself to Baba Mustapha, who did him the same service he had done to the other robbers. He did not set any particular mark on the house, but examined and observed it so carefully, by passing often by it, that it was impossible for him to mistake it.

The captain returns to the robbers' hideout in the forest, confident after successfully identifying Ali Baba's house. He meets with the remaining members of his gang in their cave and announces with confidence that nothing can now hinder their planned revenge, as he is certain of the exact location of Ali Baba's house. He shares that during his journey back, he devised a plan for their vengeance and invites any member with a better idea to propose it. After presenting his strategy, it receives the approval of his cohorts. The captain then instructs them to procure nineteen mules and thirty-eight large leather jars—one filled with oil and the rest empty—from the surrounding villages. This order sets the stage for their elaborate plan of attack, indicating a shift from straightforward confrontation to a more deceitful, covert approach.

Within two to three days, the robbers acquire all the mules and jars as instructed. However, the captain notices that the jars' openings are too small for his intended use. He orders the openings to be enlarged, adapting them to his plan. Each robber then hides inside a jar, armed and ready, while the captain ensures they have enough air to breathe by leaving a seam open. To maintain the disguise, he smears the outside of these jars with oil, making them appear like ordinary containers. This step demonstrates the captain's meticulous attention to detail and his commitment to executing his plan without raising suspicion. The use of the jars as a means of concealment for the robbers signifies a cunning and unconventional approach in their quest for vengeance against Ali Baba.

With the plan in action, the captain, posing as a mule driver, leads the nineteen mules into town at evening. Each mule carries a jar with a hidden robber, except for one filled with oil. Arriving at Ali Baba's house, he finds Ali Baba outside, enjoying the cool post-supper air, which prevents him from knocking as planned. Instead, he improvises by engaging Ali Baba in conversation. He claims to be an oil merchant who has journeyed from afar to sell his goods at the market and, due to the lateness of the hour, is without lodging. He politely asks if he might spend the night at Ali Baba's home, appealing to his sense of hospitality. This encounter demonstrates the captain's adaptability and his ability to convincingly play his assumed role, furthering their plot under the guise of an innocent merchant seeking shelter.

Despite having encountered the captain in the forest previously, Ali Baba fails to recognize him in his merchant disguise. Welcoming the stranger, he hospitably opens his gates, allowing the mules and their supposed oil jars entry into his yard. He instructs a slave to care for the mules after they are unloaded. Ali Baba then asks Morgiana, his loyal servant, to prepare a substantial supper for their guest. This moment highlights Ali Baba's kind and unsuspecting nature, as he unwittingly welcomes his enemy into his home. It also sets the stage for Morgiana's eventual crucial role in thwarting the robbers' plan, emphasizing the contrast between Ali Baba's unsuspecting trust and Morgiana's later vigilance and cunning.

Following their meal, Ali Baba instructs Morgiana to ensure their guest is well taken care of. He then mentions his plans for an early visit to the bath the next day, asking Morgiana to prepare his bathing linen and to instruct Abdalla, another servant, to make him a nourishing broth for his return. Ali Baba then retires to bed, still unaware of the imminent danger posed by their guest. This scene reflects Ali Baba's routine life and his trust in Morgiana's abilities, juxtaposing the normalcy of his household with the lurking threat of the robbers' scheme.

Once everyone in the house is asleep, the captain discreetly goes into the yard. He opens each jar to communicate with his hidden men. He instructs them to remain concealed until he gives a signal by throwing stones from the window of the room where he's staying. Upon hearing this signal, they are to emerge quickly from their jars so they can join him in executing their plan. This moment reveals the final stage of the captain's scheme, showcasing his leadership and the robbers' readiness to enact their vengeance on Ali Baba.

Following his instructions to his men, the captain heads back inside. Morgiana, carrying a light, leads him to his room for the night. After she leaves, the captain quickly extinguishes the light and remains fully clothed. This preparation allows him to be ready at a moment's notice to execute their plan. The captain's actions here are marked by caution and readiness, as he aims to maintain his guise as a harmless guest while being prepared to act swiftly when the time comes.

Morgiana busies herself with the tasks Ali Baba assigned, preparing his bathing linen and instructing Abdalla to start making the broth. However, while working, she faces an unexpected problem: their lamp runs out of oil, and they have no more in the house or any candles. Puzzled about how to proceed, especially since the broth still needs to be made, Abdalla suggests that Morgiana should use some oil from one of the jars in the yard, unaware of the danger hidden within them. This moment of innocent suggestion unknowingly sets Morgiana on a path that will lead to the discovery of the robbers' plot.

Grateful for Abdalla's suggestion, Morgiana takes an oil pot and heads to the yard to draw oil from one of the jars. As she approaches the first jar, the robber concealed inside, mistaking her for the captain giving the signal, whispers quietly, asking if it's time to act. This unexpected interaction alerts Morgiana to the presence of the robbers, revealing the imminent threat in what was supposed to be a simple task. Her discovery at this moment marks a turning point in the story, where Morgiana's quick thinking becomes crucial.

Morgiana is taken aback to discover a man inside the jar where she expected to find oil. Quickly grasping the perilous situation for herself, Ali Baba, and his family, she composes herself and responds calmly to the hidden robber, indicating that it's not yet time for action. She proceeds to check each jar in the yard, maintaining her composure and giving the same response to each robber she encounters, until she finally reaches the actual jar containing oil. Morgiana's quick wit and ability to think on her feet are critical in this moment, as she cleverly manages to prevent the robbers from realizing that their plot has been discovered.

Realizing that Ali Baba has unknowingly harbored thirty-eight robbers in his home, and that the supposed oil merchant is their leader, Morgiana acts swiftly. She fills her oil pot and heads back to the kitchen. After lighting her lamp, she grabs a large kettle, fills it with oil from the jar, and heats it over a fire. Once the oil is boiling, she courageously pours it into each jar in the yard, effectively eliminating each robber hidden inside. Morgiana's decisive and brave actions in this critical moment showcase her resourcefulness and determination to protect her master and his household from the imminent danger.

In this paragraph, Morgiana carries out her courageous plan quietly and without any disturbances. Afterward, she goes back to the kitchen with the empty kettle, extinguishes the large fire she used to heat the oil, leaving only enough for the broth. She turns off the lamp and patiently waits in silence. Morgiana intends to stay awake and observe events in the yard through a kitchen window.

In this passage, the captain of the robbers rises and attempts to signal his comrades by throwing stones at the oil jars. He assumes that the sound of the jars being hit will indicate their presence. However, no one responds to his signals, causing him great concern. He throws stones multiple times and grows increasingly anxious when there's no response. Eventually, he descends to the yard and detects the smell of hot oil emanating from one of the jars. Realizing his plan has failed, he inspects the other jars and discovers all his fellow robbers are dead. Frustrated and desperate, he escapes over the garden wall.

After observing the captain's departure, Morgiana goes to bed, feeling content and satisfied with the success of her mission to protect her master and his family.
Ali Baba, unaware of the significant events at home, rises early and heads to the baths with his slave, completely ignorant of the unfolding situation in his own house.

Upon Ali Baba's return from the baths, he is astonished to find the oil jars in his house and discovers that the supposed merchant has not left with the mules as expected. He questions Morgiana, who answers the door, to understand the situation.

Morgiana addresses Ali Baba as her good master and wishes well for him and his family. She hints at the need for him to witness something to fully understand the situation and invites him to follow her for an explanation.

Morgiana closes the door, and Ali Baba, following her, is directed to inspect the first oil jar. When he opens it, he is shocked to find a man inside and reacts with alarm, crying out in surprise.

Morgiana reassures Ali Baba, telling him not to fear. She explains that the man inside the jar is dead and poses no threat to anyone.
Ali Baba, still in shock, asks Morgiana for an explanation of what she has shown him and the situation in general.

Morgiana promises to explain and advises Ali Baba to control his amazement. She emphasizes the importance of keeping the matter confidential and instructs him to inspect the contents of the remaining jars.

Ali Baba proceeds to examine all the other jars and eventually reaches the one with oil. He discovers that it has significantly less oil than before. Overwhelmed with surprise, he stands motionless and speechless, shifting his gaze between the jars and Morgiana.

After regaining his composure, Ali Baba inquires about the fate of the merchant who had been visiting.
Morgiana clarifies that the person was not a merchant and offers to reveal his true identity and what happened to him but suggests discussing it in Ali Baba's chamber. She also emphasizes the importance of him having his broth after bathing for his health.

Morgiana proceeds to narrate the entire sequence of events to Ali Baba, starting with her discovery of the mark on the house and concluding with the defeat of the robbers and the escape of their leader.

Ali Baba expresses his gratitude to Morgiana for her courageous actions, acknowledging that she saved him from the traps set by the robbers. As a token of his appreciation, he grants her immediate freedom and promises further rewards in the future.

Ali Baba and his slave Abdalla dig a trench in Ali Baba's garden to bury the bodies of the robbers. They hide the oil jars and weapons, and Ali Baba decides to sell the mules in the market.

The captain of the forty robbers, filled with mortification and seeking revenge, returns to the forest. However, he finds the cavern's isolation unbearable and decides to avenge his comrades' deaths and eliminate Ali Baba. He disguises himself as a silk merchant and secretly transports valuable goods from the cavern to his lodging. To sell these items, he rents a warehouse opposite Ali Baba's son's place.

The captain of the robbers adopts the name Cogia Houssain and, as a newcomer, acts politely toward his fellow merchants. He befriends Ali Baba's son and cultivates a closer relationship with him. Recognizing Ali Baba during a visit, he intensifies his efforts, showering the young man with attention, gifts, and invitations to dine and sup, all while maintaining his false identity.

Ali Baba's son, feeling indebted to Cogia Houssain, wants to reciprocate his hospitality. However, his limited living space prevents him from hosting Cogia Houssain. He decides to inform his father, Ali Baba, of his desire to extend an invitation to their guest.

Ali Baba gladly accepts the responsibility of hosting Cogia Houssain. He instructs his son to invite Cogia Houssain for the following day, Friday, a day when the shops of esteemed merchants like Cogia Houssain and his son are closed. He plans to ask Morgiana to prepare a supper for their guest.

Ali Baba's son and Cogia Houssain meet as planned and take a walk together. On their way back, Ali Baba's son guides Cogia Houssain through the street where they live and stops at their house, knocking on the door.

Ali Baba's son introduces Cogia Houssain to their house, stating that it belongs to his father. He mentions that his father, upon hearing about Cogia Houssain's friendship, requested the honor of meeting him and asks Cogia Houssain to add this pleasure to the ones he has already received from them.

Cogia Houssain's true intention is to infiltrate Ali Baba's house and assassinate him without risking his own life or creating a disturbance. However, he pretends to make excuses and tries to leave. Ali Baba's son, assisted by a slave who opens the door, persuades him to stay by warmly welcoming him and leading him inside.

Ali Baba greets Cogia Houssain with a friendly and welcoming demeanor, expressing gratitude for the kindness he has shown his son. He acknowledges that the obligation is even greater because his son is a young man with limited worldly experience, and Cogia Houssain's presence could be educational for him.

Cogia Houssain reciprocates the compliment by praising Ali Baba's son's intelligence, suggesting that despite his youth, he possesses wisdom comparable to many older individuals. As Cogia Houssain prepares to leave, Ali Baba insists that he stay and dine with them, acknowledging that their hospitality might not meet his expectations but extending a heartfelt invitation nonetheless.
Cogia Houssain explains to Ali Baba that he cannot consume food containing salt. Ali Baba assures him that there is no salt in their bread and promises that the meat served for dinner will also be free of salt. He kindly insists that Cogia Houssain should stay and dine with them, requesting a moment to make the necessary arrangements.

Ali Baba instructs Morgiana in the kitchen to prepare the meat without adding any salt and to make a few additional dishes without salt as well. Morgiana, while following her master's unusual order, becomes curious about the guest who refuses to eat salt. After finishing her kitchen tasks, she assists Abdalla in carrying the dishes to the dining area. Upon seeing Cogia Houssain, she immediately recognizes him as the captain of the robbers despite his disguise and notices the dagger concealed beneath his clothing.

Morgiana realizes that Cogia Houssain, who refuses to eat salt with her master, is likely his greatest enemy with murderous intentions. During the supper, she secretly decides to carry out a bold plan to thwart him. When Abdalla arrives with dessert, Morgiana excuses herself, disguises herself as a dancer with a headdress, a silver-gilt girdle containing a dagger, and a mask. She suggests to Abdalla that they entertain their master and his son's friend with a dance, a practice they usually do when Ali Baba is alone.

Ali Baba invites Morgiana to perform a dance for Cogia Houssain, wanting him to witness her skills. Cogia Houssain, not expecting such an event after supper, becomes concerned that he might miss the opportunity to carry out his plan. However, he decides to be gracious and expresses his satisfaction with the performance, pretending to appreciate Ali Baba's gesture, which pleases Ali Baba.

After Ali Baba and Cogia Houssain finish their conversation, Abdalla starts playing the tabor, and Morgiana, known for her excellent dancing skills, performs a mesmerizing dance that would have impressed anyone who witnessed it.

Morgiana's dance continues with grace and elegance, but she surprises everyone when she takes out the poniard and incorporates it into her performance. She performs a mesmerizing dance with various intricate moves, light footwork, astonishing leaps, and remarkable stunts. At times, she pretends to aim the poniard at different parts of her body, creating a sense of danger and excitement. Finally, she takes the tabor from Abdalla with her left hand and presents the dagger in her right hand while extending the other side of the tabor, similar to the manner in which professional dancers seek tips from the audience.

During Morgiana's dance, Ali Baba and his son show their appreciation by placing pieces of gold into the tabor. Cogia Houssain, realizing that Morgiana is approaching him, attempts to take out his purse to make a gift. However, Morgiana, displaying remarkable courage and determination, stabs him with the concealed poniard, plunging it into his heart.

Ali Baba and his son are shocked and cry out when they witness Morgiana's action. Ali Baba accuses Morgiana of ruining him and his family, to which she responds that her act was to preserve, not harm them. She reveals the hidden dagger and exposes Cogia Houssain's true identity as both the fake oil merchant and the captain of the forty robbers. Morgiana points out the evidence, including his refusal to eat salt and the previous suspicions she had. She emphasizes that her suspicions were justified.

Ali Baba, realizing the debt of gratitude he owes Morgiana for saving his life a second time, embraces her and expresses his intention to fulfill his promise of rewarding her. He announces that he will make Morgiana his daughter-in-law. Ali Baba then turns to his son, confident in his son's obedience, and urges him to accept Morgiana as his wife. He emphasizes that Cogia Houssain had nefarious intentions, and Morgiana is the savior of their family. The son willingly agrees to the marriage, both out of filial duty and personal inclination.

Ali Baba and his family decide to bury the captain of the robbers and his comrades discreetly, ensuring that their bones remain undiscovered for many years, as there is no need to publicize the events. Shortly after, Ali Baba celebrates his son's marriage to Morgiana with a grand ceremony, including a lavish feast, dancing, and entertainment. Their friends and neighbors are unaware of the true reasons behind the marriage, but those who know Morgiana's virtues praise Ali Baba's generosity and kind heart. Ali Baba refrains from visiting the robbers' cave for a year, uncertain about the fate of the other two robbers who remain unaccounted for.
