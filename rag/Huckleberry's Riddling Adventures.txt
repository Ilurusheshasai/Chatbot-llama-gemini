More than 168 years ago, there lived a mysterious individual known as "Old Riddler." He was famous for his love of riddles and resided in a region where his real name was unknown. The nickname "Old Riddler" suited him well due to his age and his passion for asking riddles.

Old Riddler was not just an elderly man but also a gnome who spent most of his time underground creating intricate riddles. He would occasionally share these riddles with fellow gnomes and, on occasion, with humans. However, he preferred it when people didn't attempt to solve his riddles and let him reveal the answers.

Old Riddler's reputation grew as he performed acts of kindness for the country-folk, especially those with farms or gardens. He would lead gnomes to clear weeds from gardens, endearing him to many. He was appreciated for his helpful nature.

Old Riddler decides to share a riddle with a young goose-girl named Lois. He asks her a riddle about a ship full of sailors at the bottom of the sea and waits for her answer. Lois tries to solve it, but Old Riddler eventually provides the correct answer and emphasizes the importance of letting him reveal the answers to his riddles.

Lois shares that she enjoys making riddles herself. Huckleberry, Old Riddler's son, comes across a small girl and tries to engage her with riddles. However, the girl is too young to understand them, and she falls asleep.

Huckleberry continues his mission to teach people things and encounters Lois again, this time asking her a riddle about an elephant with a glass globe of goldfish tied to its tail. Lois guesses the answer correctly. Huckleberry encourages her to guess riddles for others if she believes the riddle has no answer.

Lois contemplates the challenge of doing two things that seem mutually exclusive, ultimately deciding to have nothing more to do with riddles. Her internal conflict highlights the moral and social lessons learned throughout the story.

Despite Old Riddler's small stature, he felt encouraged by the kindness of those who appreciated his riddles. People who showed interest in his conundrums often found themselves pleased to have met him.

The gnomes, including Old Riddler, had various ways to help the country-folks, such as clearing gardens of weeds. Old Riddler's influence allowed him to orchestrate acts of kindness for people, making him a beloved figure.

Approaching Lois politely, Old Riddler asked her to solve his riddle: "Why is a ship full of sailors at the bottom of the sea like the price of beef?"

Lois, the goose-girl, began contemplating Old Riddler's riddle while scratching her head in thought.

Lois ventured a guess, suggesting, "Because it's 'low.'"

Old Riddler rejected Lois's answer and suggested that she could give up if the correct answer eluded her.

Lois attempted another guess, proposing, "Because it's sunk."

Old Riddler, growing a bit impatient, explained that continually guessing might ruin the riddle and advised Lois to give up.

Undeterred, Lois asked for the correct answer to the riddle.
